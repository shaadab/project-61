        <p>Sachin Tendulkar is great not because of his cricketing performance; if that were the case, approximately the same level of adulation would have been reserved for Rahul Dravid also, who is also in the same category in terms of performanc.164 Tests, 13288 runs vs Sachin's 198 Tests, 15837 runs.As you can see, nothing to choose between the two.In one dayers, of course, Sachin is quite a bit ahead: 39 vs 44 in averages. But not enough to justify the adulation for Sachin.To my mind, Sachin is great primarily because of his age when he came onto the cricket world; to do what he did at the age of 16 is tremendous. Think of what you were at 16 and then think of Imran, Waqar and Wasim steaming in to you at 16 years of age, in front of a partisan crowd, with all India watching. Think of yourself at 16 facing upto arch enemy Pakistan. Think of yourself at age 16 getting . smashed on your body with a leather ball. Think of yourself at age 16 in front of a screaming crowd, trying to focus on the ball.</p>
